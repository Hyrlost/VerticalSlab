# Vertical Slab Mod

Hi! I'm Hyrlost. I just want to let you know what the mod is. It is a mod where the we can have a vertical slab! We can put it on four different position and now we can do constructions that before were impossible!

In this mod I had to work with different models and different kind of states, in this way, the rendering was the correct according to the position of the object. Also, I had to integrate a bit of maths to determine the position of the vertical slab. Have fun! :D

Here you can find a gif where you can see the mod working: https://giphy.com/gifs/lBO7JnxJbwbfPLtMUQ
